# Machine_Learning_in_Systems

Welcome! This repository holds the crucial code from my learning experience in the course CSCE 689: Machine Learning in Systems.

**Repository Contents:**
- **CNN Research Paper:** An analysis of Deep/Wide CNN vs. ResNet performance on various Nvidia GPUs.
- **Pytorch Resnet/Cifar-10 CPU/GPU DNN:** Code utilized for the CNN research paper experiments.
- **Abstract Scraping:** Scraping of abstracts from the ISLR conference to create a dataset.
- **"Neural Network"/"Python Generative RNN":** My award-winning GRNN which took ISLR conference abstracts, and produced novel, human-passable abstracts.
- **"Neural Network"/"RNN_GRU_pt4_loss":** The saved gradient from the award-wining GRNN, which can be loaded with the code.
